# 📌 Probability of Default (PD)

## 🧠 What Is PD?

**Probability of Default (PD)** means:

> How likely a borrower is to fail to repay a loan within a given period (usually 12 months).

If PD = **5%**, it means:

Out of 100 similar customers, about **5 may default**.

PD is a **probability value**, not a credit score.

## 🎯 Why PD Is Needed Even If We Have a Credit Score

A **credit score shows ranking**.  
PD shows **actual risk level**.

Think of it like this:

- Score = position in a class  
- PD = chance of failing the exam  

Two people can have the same score but very different PD.

### Example

| Person | Score | PD |
|------|------|----|
| A | 750 | 2% |
| B | 750 | 8% |

Same score → different danger level.

Only PD reveals this.

## 🏦 What Banks Really Care About

Banks must know:

> How many customers are expected to default?

Not just:

> Who is better than whom?

That is why PD is mandatory in real banking systems.

## 🔁 Relationship Between PD and Score


They are related, but **not identical**.

## 🧠 Why Logistic Regression Is Used for PD

- Produces real probabilities  
- Easy to interpret  
- Trusted by regulators  
- Stable and simple  

Therefore PD is generated using **Logistic Regression**.

## 🧠 Simple Mental Model

| Component | Meaning |
|---------|--------|
| PD | How dangerous |
| Score | Where you rank |
| Risk | Which group |
| Decision | What to do |

All four are required.

## 🏁 Final Statement

> PD tells how likely someone will default.  
> Score tells how they compare to others.  
> A real credit system needs both.
